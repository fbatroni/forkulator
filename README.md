Wouldn't it be nice if you could just make some arbitrary executable run by calling
a properly formed URL. Like, you already have a shell script that tests the health of your
application you just want to make it accessible for your HTTP based monitoring solution. 
Enter `forkulator` the application that just runs your executable files and returns the output.
